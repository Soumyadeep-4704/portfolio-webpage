    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
        I'm <b>Soumyadeep Paul</b>, currently a second year udergraduate at Mechanical Branch of <b>NIT Silchar</b>. Though my academics roam around the mechanical systems, I've a keen interest in the tech domain. 
        The endless possibilities that technology presents have sparked my interst in the development, a field where i can blend my creativity and technical skills.
        As a budding developer this is my first portfolio webpage project in the world of web developing. This venture not only allows me to apply what I've learned but also to explore new horizons and make meaningful contributions to the digital landscape.
        My programming journey started with the basics of <b>C</b> and <b>C++</b>, which I learned during my first year.
        Now I've started <b>Data Structures and Algorithms </b>in <b>C++</b> to strengthen my programming foundation. I've also attended a workshop on <b>Android Development</b> .
