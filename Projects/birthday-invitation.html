        Hey natives,
        <br />
        It's that time of the year again – my birthday is coming up, and I would love for you to join in the celebration!
        We’re going to have a blast with great music, delicious food, and plenty of fun activities. Your presence will make the day extra special, so I hope you can make it!
        Please RSVP by 3rd of JULY, 2024 so I can make sure there’s enough cake for everyone.
        <br /> <br />
        Looking forward to celebrating with you!
        <br /> <br />
        Best regards,<br />
